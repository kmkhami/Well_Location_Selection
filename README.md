# Well_Location_Selection
This project was done as a part of the Energy Analytics Stream in the UT Austin Freshman Research Initiative. The relevant code and documentation is in the [project_notebook]() file. 
### Objective 
The goal of this project was to use the Python Data Stack to create a ML algorithm that would select well locations in a theoretical basin. The data used to train our model was given to us by our professor, Dr. Jesse Pisel and can be found [here]().
